## [NOTE] NO LONGER BEING UPDATED
Just wanted to add this note to inform anyone still looking at this repo that node-elisif is no longer being worked on. I do not have the time to finish the new rewrite version of this package, neither to keep this package up to date, nor to ensure that it is always compatible with the ever-changing discord.js library. Feel free to fork the repo and do so yourself if you need it updated. Development on this repo ended around June 2022. The latest dev version of this package, in the [full-rewrite branch](https://github.com/Cannicide/node-elisif/tree/full-rewrite), is compatible with discord.js v13 and could probably be updated by others to work with newer discord.js versions. It was never finished, but provides several utilities that were in my mind useful. The full-rewrite version was good enough that I used it myself on some of the bots I made in 2022, but since the package isn't complete, it couldn't fully replace all of the functionality of discord.js. I may go back and update the package at some point in the future, but for now, this repo will be relentlessly trapped in mid-2022.



## Information
A powerful Discord Bot container, command handler, and vast extension of discord.js designed to be both simplistic and feature-rich. Based on the command handler and various systems I developed for my three discord bots: Elisif, Panacea, and Scavenger.

**Note: buttons, select menus, threads, and slash commands have not been fully tested yet.** Certain parts of the code, especially these new features, *may* cause errors. If you encounter any issues, please report them via Issue on the [Github repository](https://github.com/Cannicide/node-elisif).

Support for buttons and select menus has been added! Support for Voice Channel Activities (VCA) has been added; note, however, that this Discord feature is limited as it is still in early beta. Support for slash commands has also been added, designed to work very similarly to classic commands. Partial support for thread channels has also been added, including creating, editing, archiving, deleting, and adding members to threads! Thread-based events and events in threads, however, are not supported due to lack of support for such events in Discord API v8.

Even more new features are still being developed for node-elisif! A moderation expansion is being worked on, and will be updated to include new buttons, alerts, punishment methods, auto-moderation, and more!

Limited [documentation](https://github.com/Cannicide/node-elisif/blob/main/docs) currently exists for this module, found in the `docs` folder of the Github repository. The docs are still being worked on, and will be published to a website that will be linked here once completed.
