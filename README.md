# node-elisif [INCOMPLETE]
A powerful Discord Bot container, command handler, and partial extension of discord.js designed to be both simplistic and feature-rich. Based on the command handler and various systems I developed for my three discord bots: Elisif, Panacea, and Scavenger.

**Note: node-elisif has not been completed yet and is under construction.** Attempting to use it now may cause errors, and will not yield the expected results. Please return after the code has been developed to a usable extent.
