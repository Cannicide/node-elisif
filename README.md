## Information
A powerful Discord Bot container, command handler, and partial extension of discord.js designed to be both simplistic and feature-rich. Based on the command handler and various systems I developed for my three discord bots: Elisif, Panacea, and Scavenger.

**Note: node-elisif has not been fully completed and tested yet.** Certain parts of the code, especially new features such as buttons and select menus, *may* cause errors.

Several new updates are coming to node-elisif! Support for buttons and select menus has been added (still being worked on). Support for Voice Channel Activities (VCA) has been added; note, however, that this Discord feature is limited as it is still in early beta. A moderation expansion is also being worked on, and will be updated to include new buttons, alerts, punishment methods, auto-moderation, and more!

No documentation currently exists for this module. Documentation is being worked on and will be linked here once completed. The upcoming moderation features and documentation will be available in node-elisif 2.x.x versions.
